# Com-Shot README

On every `git commit` the recently worked files which are added via `git add` gets snapshoted.

When you open your branch again via `git checkout <yourbranch>` the snapshoted files will open as tabs.

This extension should help you working on different branches more efficient.

## TODOS:

- On "git commit" in terminal extension must run or
- On "save commit" as VSC command terminal must do a "git commit" and asking for commit-message
- all changed files must be snapshoted
- on git checkout the snapshoted files must open as tabs
